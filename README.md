This thesis investigates how to build a website for real restate price prediction by using sklearn and linear regression for bangalore home price dataset from kaggle.com. secondly, wrote a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Thirdly, the website built in by using html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.

During the model building I have done the data loading, cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, GridSearchCv for hyperparameter tuning, k fold cross validation etc. have been done.

Technology and tools used in this project:

Python
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
Python flask server for http server
HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
Cloud (AWS EC2)
Ignix server
