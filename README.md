This thesis investigates how to build a website for real restate price prediction by using sklearn and linear regression for bangalore home price dataset from kaggle.com. secondly, wrote a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Thirdly, the website built in by using html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. 

During the model building I have done the data loading, cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimentionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparametr tunning, k fold cross validation etc. have been done.

Technology and tools used in this project:
1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask server for http server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
8. Cloud (AWS EC2)
9. Inginx server
